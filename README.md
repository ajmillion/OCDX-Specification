# Open Community Data Exchange 

The Open Community Data Exchange is an open standard for describing data about online communities.

In an effort to support tools and workflow for researchers and data providers to share their datasets with the wider community, we devised a minimum set of metadata fields that would be important to quickly understand a dataset and work with it.

We stress the word "minimum" here, seeking the lowest barrier to contributing/sharing data with the wider [OCDF](http://datafactories.org) community.

We welcome your input. Please use [Issues](https://github.com/libbyh/miocs/issues) to suggest information for inclusion in the MIOCS or even the extensible metadata. You should also submit pull requests if you feel comfortable editing the docs directly.
